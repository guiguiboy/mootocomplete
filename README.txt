Mootocomplete

By Guiguiboy

version 0.1

A personal implementation of autocomplete using Mootolos 1.4.5.

Currently in alpha, use at your own risks ! API may change a lot ... And there is a lot of things to improve.

Mootocomplete is an autocompleter to use when you need an autocomplete that can handle ajax queries.
The work is done on the server side. Mootocomplete only displays the results on the client.
Currently, Mootocomplete does not support initialization from array.



Usages :

List of improvements to be done
 - close autocomplete on blur
 - handle hidden input elements (such as ids)
 - total style customization (with usage examples)
 - bold searched characters that are in the response
 - ask javascript guru how to improve this script
 - unit tests (but with what lib ??!)
